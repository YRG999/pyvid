# Programming notes

1. Created 2 files at first, `capture.py` and `serve.py` as I thought they had to be different, but the ChatGPT guide had just partitioned them out this was to explain things. The functions needed to be in the same file.
2. Didn't realize I had to go to `http://127.0.0.1:5001/video_feed`
3. Created `capture+serve.py` with both functions, but got some errors.
4. Updated the errors as suggested and created `capture_video.py`, which ran in a browser.
